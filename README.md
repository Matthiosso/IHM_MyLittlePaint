### About the program
<b>My Catsome Painter</b> has been designed by Anaïs SEYVE and Matthieu CLEMENT for the 20th October 2015. This program allows you to paint on an image either free or with specifics shapes (rectangle, ellipse), to fill a zone, to register your work wherever you want in PNG, to print it and to open a PNG image...

### Elements used
We used [Qt Creator](http://www.qt.io/ide/) to develop the program. Moreover, different tools have been used, as the Qt example named Scribble Area to start, the [Wikipedia Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill) to fill a zone, the website [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/) and the [Qt documentation](http://doc.qt.io/).
The icons have been entirely drawn by ourselves. All rights are reserved.
We thank you for using our program, and hope it suits you.
